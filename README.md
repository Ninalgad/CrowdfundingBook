## Statistical Analysis Cont.
### Q: "Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data."
A: The median better summarizes the data and is a better indication of `central tendency' as two distributions are highly skewed as evidenced by the very high variances computed.

### Q: "Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?"
A: The proportion between the 'variability with successful campaigns' and 'variability with unsuccessful campaigns' is computed as: \
'variability with successful campaigns' / 'variability with unsuccessful campaigns' = 1603373.732 / 921574.6817 = 1.78 > 1 \
which is greater than 1. Hence, there is more variability with successful campaigns. A possible explanation is the bi-modal nature of the goals of successful campaigns.
Since lower goals are more likely to be successful with fewer bakers, the count distribution becomes tail-heavy towards the low-baker counts. Once non-low-goal campaigns are included, the count data then becomes highly variable.
